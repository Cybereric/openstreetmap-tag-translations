Furthermore you can describe the tags with the array $tag_type. Every
entry is an array again to further specify its type, e.g.:
$tag_type["width"]=array("number", "m", "in");
              ^             ^       ^    ^
              |             |       |    \-- the preferred unit in this locale
              |             |       \------- the default unit for this tag
              |             \--------------- the type of the value
              \----------------------------- tag

This defines, that the default value for the tag width is a number, with
its default unit m (for meter) and the preferred unit for this locale is
in (for inch).

The following types are valid:
* text          default (e.g. religion, name)
* number        a value, with default unit and preferred unit as defined
                by the second and third entry in this array (e.g. width,
                voltage)
* count         an integer value (e.g. population)
* date          a date
* link          an Internet URL

NOTE: the $tag_type can already be defined, but it's not used yet.
There might also be more tag types soon and a way to format the output
(e.g. "100.000 m" or "2010-12-24").
